# Christ's Upper Hall Calendar Script

I wrote this script in Lent 2016. It takes the Upper Hall menus at Christ's College, Cambridge (in case you were coming from elsewhere) and produces a calendar file which you can import into your own calendar.
Specifically, this is meant to export the menus to the calendar. You can read these in the event descriptions.

Christ's Upper Hall is accessed via the college internet. As such, one needs to use this script within the university network.
Presumably, one needs to have access rights to the college intranet. Put another way, be a member of Christ's.

Using this script is simple, but you'll need your raven login details to hand.

Just run:

```bash

python upperhall.py

```

And follow the instructions.

This will spit out an ics calendar. In the university, I released a link to a Google Calendar which would pull the ics file from SRCF.
You'll have to upload this calendar yourself to your prefered calendar app. 

As I have now graduated and left, I no longer maintain this, but I'm perfectly (and I hope obviously) happy to approve pull requests et cetera.

Happy Halling.
